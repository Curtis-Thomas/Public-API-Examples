Public API Examples is a GitHub project that aims to showcase the potential of public APIs using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The project features a collection of examples that demonstrate how to use various public APIs in web development.

The project is designed to be beginner-friendly, making it easy for anyone to get started with using public APIs in their web development projects. Each example includes a brief explanation of the API being used, along with the code needed to integrate it into a web page.

The project covers a wide range of public APIs, including weather APIs, news APIs, social media APIs, and more. Some examples may include fetching data from an API and displaying it on a web page, while others may involve integrating APIs into more complex web applications.

The user interface of Public API Examples is sleek and modern, making it easy to navigate and find examples that are relevant to your needs. The project is regularly updated with new examples as new APIs become available, ensuring that developers always have access to the latest and most relevant information.
